        "## Overview\n",
        "This Jupyter notebook presents a report on anomalies and outliers detected in driver performance metrics. The report is generated based on a dataset containing various performance indicators for taxi drivers. By identifying anomalies, it aims to provide insights into potential issues or exceptional cases within the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Description\n",
        "The report includes a detailed analysis of driver performance metrics such as endurance score, profitability score, safety adherence score, and efficiency score. It also highlights percentile values for each metric, enabling users to compare individual driver scores with the dataset's overall distribution. Additionally, the report features a \"sanity check\" column to confirm the presence of anomalies based on predefined percentile thresholds.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Purpose\n",
        "The purpose of this report is to facilitate data-driven decision-making by offering visibility into outliers and anomalies in driver performance metrics. By flagging potential issues or exceptional cases, it helps stakeholders identify areas for further investigation or improvement. Ultimately, the report contributes to enhancing the quality and reliability of decision-making processes within the taxi service domain."

        "## How to Use\n",
        "1. **Identify Anomalies**: Look for rows where the \"Sanity Check\" column is marked as True. These rows represent anomalies in the driver performance metrics.\n",
        "2. **Analyze Metric Scores**: Focus on metrics with highlighted cells (background color yellow). These cells indicate that the corresponding metric value falls outside the normal range (outside 1st or 99th percentile).\n",
        "3. **Compare with Percentiles**: Compare the metric values with their respective 1st and 99th percentile values provided in the report. This helps in understanding how far the metric values deviate from the normal range.\n",
        "\n",
        "By following these steps, users can effectively identify and investigate anomalies and outliers in driver performance metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **_NOTE:_** The sanity check should ideally be true for all entries in this report. However, in future iterations of this report, it will be possible to toggle the percentile values used for analyzing the data. Users will be able to customize both the percentile value that defines the normal range and the percentile value that identifies an anomaly. This feature will be particularly useful for examining extreme values that fall within the required percentile range but still may be of interest for further investigation.\n",
