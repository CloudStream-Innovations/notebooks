        "# Data Preparation for ETL Process\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "This notebook guides you through the initial steps to prepare a dataset for the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process using Python. The dataset will undergo preprocessing to ensure it meets the requirements for subsequent data processing tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Description\n",
        "The notebook covers the following data preparation steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Unzip File**: The original dataset file is often compressed for storage or transfer. The `unzip_file` function extracts the contents of the compressed file, allowing access to the dataset for preprocessing.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Copy Original File**: Once the dataset is extracted, a backup or working copy is created. This ensures that any modifications made during preprocessing do not affect the original data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Create Rows**: Certain data formats may require specific delimiters or formatting for processing. The `create_rows` function addresses this by modifying the dataset's structure to ensure compatibility with downstream processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Square Brackets**: Another common data formatting requirement involves enclosing data within square brackets, typically for JSON formatting. The `square_brackets` function adds square brackets around the dataset's content to meet this formatting standard.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Pretty Print**: Finally, the `pretty_print` function enhances the readability of the dataset by adding indentation to the JSON content. This step is optional but can greatly improve the dataset's readability and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "By following these steps, you'll prepare the dataset for efficient data extraction, transformation, and loading operations in subsequent stages of the ETL process."
